I do not like January. That has profound reasons related to the cold and/or wet weather, salt residues on my good winter boots and me losing a pair of gloves almost every winter. Of course, there are some casual health issues for the new year with me ending up visiting the emergency room at some point within the next 2 months.

### Gathered Data

But all this complaining aside, I had a 50-50 month. I did pretty well in the first half and then lost it in the second half of the  month. My Polar Loop stats go as following: 5 days 7 hours  active time tracked and the daily activity goal was only 74% completed this month. With the help of Endomondo, I have tracked 151KM walking with a time of 27h and 58 minutes.

### What's next?

I'm still having issues with the way I track my daily activity - I'm currently wearing 2 sensors on a daily basis. The Polar Loop[^loop] is fine to get an immediate response of how much of the daily goal I have achieved. The Moov Now[^moov] sensor is ideal for sleep tracking and understanding other parts of my daily activity. I really want to have something that unites these 2 platforms or at least something that offers me a similar experience. I have to look at my options and maybe give Withings Activit√©[^activite] a try - or Fitbit[^fitbit].

[^loop]:    I do like the Loop, but [Polar](http://www.polar.com/){:target="_blank"} has now released the [A360](http://www.polar.com/uk-en/products/sport/A360){:target="_blank"} as an alternative fitness tracker with a wrist-based heart rate monitor.
[^moov]:  I do love the coach app for [Moov Now](http://welcome.moov.cc){:target="_blank"}. When all the snow is gone and I can actually go for a run, I'll post a review on it.
[^activite]:  [This](http://www.withings.com/eu/en/products/activite){:target="_blank"} has been on my radar for some time now. I am a watch wearer, do own multiple watches and this would be nice to have. The only problem would be the superficial me that wants to wear different watches depending on the mood and time of the day.
[^fitbit]:  I have been thinking about the Fitbit [ChargeHR](https://www.fitbit.com/eu/chargehr){:target="_blank"} as a possible option.
