I'm trying something new this time - a weekly roundup.

### Roundup

- **Wellness/Fitness** - Been walking somewhat a lot, not as much as the week before. Have tracked 97km over the past 7 days. I'm 2kg past my weekly weight goal. Lately, I'm not happy with my sleep. I seem to get regularly from 6 to 9 hours sleep. The amount of restorative sleep is unfortunately only around 40%.
- **Development** - I have opted for semantic versioning or [SemVer][semver]{:target="_blank"} for all present and future projects. Also on a similar note, [this][infinite]{:target="_blank"} article about infinite versions of Google Chrome is a good read.
- **Fun** - I enjoyed solving the puzzles provided by [GCHQ][gchq]{:target="_blank"} and [Advent of Code][adventofcode]{:target="_blank"} for this holiday season. I'm stuck on the fourth GCHQ challenge, for now, doing well with Advent of Code challenges. I'll keep trying.
- **Random thought** - What would be the quickest solution for learning to read and possibly speak mandarin?
