Started 2 new projects this week and one of them is a RSVP web application. There are some really good services available online that offer even more value, like online ticketing and so forth. I did not find any acceptable apps to host myself. Some of the available apps are complicated. I need something simple. So I thought, I'll give it a try and start an open source project of my own. Who knows, maybe it is useful to someone else as well.

### Roundup

- **Development** - One of the started projects is [RSVP](/projects/rsvp/). The goal is to have a simple and administrable RSVP application to host on your own servers. 
- **Reading** - Started reading "[Mining the Social Web][oreilly]{:target="_blank"}" by Matthew A. Russell. This is one of the topics that I have been struggling with and I really hope to get some good pointers from this book.
- **Games** - Taking a short break from gaming in general. I feel like this is currently a waste of time and I have way better things to occupy my mind with. Maybe next week I'll pick it up again.
- **Random thought** - Seems like I have new priorities now ... strange feeling this "being an adult" thing ...
